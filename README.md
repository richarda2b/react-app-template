# React app template

Provides boilerplate for creating a new react app. Uses [React](https://github.com/reactjs) (duh!), [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) and it is bundled with [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)


## Instructions

Requires [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Running

  - Clone the repo
  - Run `yarn` (or `npm install`)
  - Run `yarn dev` - it will start a [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) with *Hot Module Replacement* enabled.
  - go to `localhost:8080` on your browser - you should see a very basic react app

## Features

  - Routing between */home*, */about* and */contact* is done via `react-router`
  - It has [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) configured for react
